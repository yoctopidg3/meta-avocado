# Build-time code generation needs these host tools, none of which can be the
# target build:
#   python3-native      - runs the codegen scripts
#   flatbuffers-native  - host flatc for schema codegen (see the SRC_URI patch;
#                         the bundled flatc builds for the target)
#   torchgen-native     - the ATen schema + codegen modules gen_oplist/codegen.gen
#                         import. Pinned to torch 2.12.0 (the version ExecuTorch
#                         1.3.1 requires); the packaged python3-pytorch is 2.4.1,
#                         too old - its schema lacks ops like mean.dtype_out.
#   python3-pyyaml-native, python3-typing-extensions-native - torchgen's only
#                         third-party imports.

# gen_oplist runs as `python3 -m codegen.tools.gen_oplist`, and cmake resolves
# that `python3` to the build container's interpreter, not the OE native one -
# so it ignores the native sysroot's site-packages where torchgen is staged.
# Put both import roots on PYTHONPATH explicitly: ${WORKDIR} for the executorch
# package (this source tree, named `executorch` via destsuffix) and the native
# site-packages for torchgen (pure-python, no torch C-extension, so the
# container interpreter loads it fine).

# Minimal portable C++ runtime.  All backends (XNNPACK, CUDA, Vulkan, QNN,
# OpenVINO, ARM Ethos-U), Python bindings, tests, and devtools are disabled
# so the recipe cross-compiles without host-side PyTorch or GPU toolchains.
# The MODULE extension is the high-level load-and-run API we want; DATA_LOADER,
# FLAT_TENSOR, and NAMED_DATA_MAP are its transitive preset requirements
# (tools/cmake/preset/default.cmake), not independently selected.
